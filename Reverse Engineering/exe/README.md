UPX Packed
-

Sometime UPX packed binary can't decompressed back. So author is manually changed some byte or even sections. 

  * You can try to guess
  * Missing library. Append kernel32.dll to actual binary. [code](https://github.com/ByamB4/CCC/blob/master/Reverse%20Engineering/exe/src/append-kernel32.py)
